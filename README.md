Addon created specfifically for the WoW Server Nyctermoon    https://nyctermoonwow.net/

Setup:

Have the "Savant" and "New Beginnings" or "Silvertongue" shirt.  All 3 shirts provide maxmimum functionalility but only two are required. 


This mod is created to facilitate the automatic switching of shirts in Nyctermoon.  The reason this was created is because oftentimes you have these shirts as a low level character and need to constsantly switch between them while out questing and gathering.  Therefore this addon was created to automate this process.    

You automatically switch to the "New Beginnings" (which adds 100% xp)  shirt when you target an enemy, or open a quest turn in window.  You can click the minimap button to turn this into Reputation mode which instead keeps the "Silvertongue" shirt equipped in those situations.

You automatically switch to the "Savant" (which gives 5 skillups for professions) shirt when mining, skinning, or performing herbalism.  Also you switch when you open a profession window.
